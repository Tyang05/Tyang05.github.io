                For this project, my friend and I created a system that provided cooling and Lighting
                depending on the surrounding environment. We the programmed the microcontroller (STM32407VG) 
                using embedded C language. The system consisted of different types of hardware (e.g. sensors, motors,
                microcontroller, LCD, LED). If the environment is dark, the system will turn on LED at different
                brightness levels depending on how dark it is. The system will turn on a motor to turn a fan at different
                speeds depending on how hot it is. The system would also display to the user the brightness/speed levels. 
                Not only that, but there were buttons used to allow the user to manually adjust the brightness and speed.

                    The smart mirrow is a mirror I build for my sister's birthday. This used a 
                    computer monitor to display anything I wanted. This monitor would be placed behind a two-way mirror 
                    that would allow the user to see what's being displayed and could use it as a regular mirrow. I 
                    had to use woodworking to build the mirror frame as well. The main purpose of this project was to 
                    give my sister a cool little birthday present. It also helped me learn more about how to code a 
                    Raspberry Pi and work more on my woodworking skills.

                This small and simple opened car door counter was a small little project I did.
                Although I did not set it up with an actual car, I was able to wire the circuit up and 
                test my circuit on a breadboard. This system basically calculates how many doors are opened on a car.
                I used multiple switches and flipped them on or off to represent a door being opened or closed.
                Depening on how many doors are opened, it would display the number of doors opened on a seven-segment display.
                The purpose of this project was to help me understand how to use different IC (integrated circuit) chips and how
                to use a seven-segment display.
