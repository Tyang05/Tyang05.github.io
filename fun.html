                Exploring the earth and enjoying nature is something I always want to do. 
                I want to be able to travel the world and see its beauty with my own eyes. 
                These are just a few photos I've taken with my phone, but it just shows 
                how stunning the world looks. Exploring the world helps me remember to always 
                admire the things around me. Take the time to pause and take everything around me in. 
                It also reminds me to do my best to take care of the world. These photos have been taken from 
                my point of view and I want others to be able to see the world from my perspective as well. 
                Exploring with friends and family is always a fun thing to do!
