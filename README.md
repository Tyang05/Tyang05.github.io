# Personal Webpage
This is my personal page that I created in the fall of 2021. This project consisted of four different pages. There was a home page that gives a brief introduction of who I am and what my goals are. It also have a portrait photo of me and a cool background photo I took in Duluth. The projects page describes the different projects I have worked on with a photo and description. At the time, I had more electrical engineering projects, so I added those instead. The resume page is pretty straight forward. It just have my fall 2021 resume on there. The last page is the one I really enjoyed making the most. That page is the fun facts page. This page basically shows who I am and what I like doing outside of school. A cool feature I added was adding photos I have taken from my travels. I love traveling and hiking, so I take photos of really cool scenary. If you hover over the photos and click on them, it will send you to a link on google maps of where I took those photos. This project worked very closely with the Foundation framework. It also got us familiar with accessibility and responsiveness with those who have other devices such as iPhones or laptops. It also helped me get familiar with coding in HTML and CSS, and I was able to see how all the files connect together.
